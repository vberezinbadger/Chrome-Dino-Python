## Chrome Dino (Python)

![Project Splash](https://github.com/vberezinbadger/Chrome-Dino-Python/blob/main/assets/splash-dino.png?raw=true)

### A little bit about the project

Hi! This project was created as one of the implementations of the Chrome Dino game (included in the delivery of Google's Chrome browser), and has several differences from other implementations and alterations in that it is closer to the original in terms of movement.

This project is a reworking of another project where I was inspired to create my own implementation ([link to the project](https://github.com/WahidSaeed/Chrome-Dino-JS)), and it is a reworking of the project into another programming language (Python) instead of JavaScript. For the most part, only the database is implemented in the project, so you can make a fork and supplement it. For example, by adding something new, or by adding what is in the original game.

**[WahidSaeed](https://github.com/WahidSaeed/Chrome-Dino-JS)** Thank you for creating the database and the exciting experience of rewriting one project into another programming language!

> Don't swear too much: the project was made literally on the knee, and on interest, and in places it can be artefacted, frizzed and sprinkled with errors. You can always do better.

### Preparation for use

-	First of all, **clone the repository** using:
```
git clone https://github.com/vberezinbadger/Chrome-Dino-Python.git
```
**OR**
Download the Zip and extract it's contents.

-	Then download the dependencies in your Command Prompt OR Terminal using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

-	After installation, just run the [`main.py`](https://github.com/vberezinbadger/Chrome-Dino-Python/blob/main/main.py) using
```
python main.py
```

### Notes

> [!NOTE]
> The project runs on all operating systems in graphical mode. Run it on Windows, macOS and Linux systems.

This project works on all operating systems with `Python 3.12` and higher installed. I strongly recommend not using versions older than the recommended one: the project may not start or will start, but with errors.
